Forking @EMLommers Apollolake_Audio so it works with GalliumOS3.1
Please note there will be no updates or further releases unless there is a bug or there is a new version of galliumos, thank you.
Instructions are, Download the zip file or use git clone, go into the modified files with thunar, make it executable, and then run ./apollolakegallium.sh
